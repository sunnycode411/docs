        <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This report serves as a definitive codex of fundamental algorithms for the modern computer science practitioner. It provides not only canonical Python implementations but also a nuanced analysis of their performance characteristics and the design trade-offs inherent in their various forms. The focus is on bridging theoretical principles with practical, high-quality code. The document is organized into thematic sections, from foundational number theory and searching to advanced graph traversal and dynamic programming paradigms. Each algorithm is presented with a concise explanation, a formal complexity analysis, and illustrative code to facilitate a deep and functional understanding.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">

        <p class="mb-4">
            The brute-force paradigm is the most straightforward approach to problem-solving. It involves systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement. While often not the most efficient, it is a valuable starting point for understanding a problem's complexity and can be effective for small problem sizes.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            A classic example is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which seeks the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. A brute-force solution involves calculating the length of every possible permutation of cities and selecting the shortest one.

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">1.2 Recursion</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller, self-similar instances of the same problem. A recursive function must have one or more base cases that terminate the recursion, preventing infinite loops. This approach often leads to elegant and intuitive solutions that mirror the mathematical definition of a problem.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Many algorithms covered in this report, such as the naive Fibonacci implementation, Depth-First Search, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, are naturally expressed using recursion.

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">1.3 Divide and Conquer</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Divide and Conquer is a recursive strategy that breaks a problem into smaller, independent subproblems of the same type, solves them recursively, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem. This paradigm is the foundation for many of the most efficient algorithms in computer science.
        </p>

            Key examples detailed later in this report include:

            <li>Merge Sort and Quick Sort, which divide an array into smaller subarrays to be sorted.</li>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Greedy algorithms build a solution step-by-step by making the locally optimal choice at each stage, with the hope of finding a global optimum. While this strategy does not guarantee an optimal solution for all problems, it is highly effective and efficient for certain classes of problems, such as finding minimum spanning trees or shortest paths with non-negative weights.

            Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique for solving optimization and counting problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. It solves each subproblem only once and stores its solution, typically in a table (or array), thereby avoiding redundant computations. This section explores two classic problems that are elegantly solved using DP: the 0/1 Knapsack problem and the Longest Common Subsequence problem.

        <p class="mb-4">
            The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, the goal is to determine which items to include in a knapsack of a fixed capacity to maximize the total value. In the "0/1" variant, the decision for each item is binary: either take the entire item or leave it behind.

The backtracking algorithm places queens column by column, and for each column, it tries to place a queen in a row where it is not attacked by already placed queens. If a valid row is found, it recursively moves to the next column. If no valid row is found in the current column, it backtracks to the previous column and moves the queen there to a new row.

            Sudoku can be solved efficiently using backtracking. The algorithm iterates through empty cells, trying to place a valid number (1-9) in each.

            Quick Sort is another powerful divide-and-conquer algorithm that is often faster in practice than other <span class="math-formula">$O(n \log n)$</span> algorithms due to smaller constant factors and cache-friendly behavior. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The pivot is placed in its final sorted position. This process is then applied recursively to the sub-arrays.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The performance of Quick Sort is highly dependent on the choice of pivot. A good pivot splits the array into roughly equal-sized partitions, leading to balanced recursion. A poor pivot leads to unbalanced partitions and degrades performance.

This ensures the largest element is at the root of the heap. Second, it repeatedly extracts the maximum element (the root), swaps it with the last element in the unsorted portion of the array, reduces the heap size by one, and restores the max-heap property for the remaining elements.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Graph traversal is the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph. Such traversals are fundamental to solving a vast array of problems in computer science, from network routing to artificial intelligence. The two most essential traversal algorithms are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
        </p>

        <h5 class="text-md sm:text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mb-2">Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices "level by level." It begins at a specified source node, visits all of its immediate neighbors, then visits the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on. This systematic, expanding-wave exploration ensures that it discovers all nodes at a given distance (in terms of number of edges) before moving to nodes at the next distance level. A key property of BFS is that it is guaranteed to find the shortest path from the source to any other node in an unweighted graph.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The behavior of BFS is dictated by its use of a queue, a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. The queue ensures that nodes are processed in the order they are discovered, which is the mechanism that drives the level-by-level traversal.

            The behavior of DFS is governed by its use of a stack, a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure. The stack ensures that the most recently discovered node is the next one to be explored.

        <p class="mb-4">
            The algorithm maintains a set of visited nodes and a data structure that stores the tentative shortest distance from the source to every other node. It operates as follows:

A hash function is used to compute an index into an array of "buckets" or "slots," from which the desired value can be found. A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the buckets to minimize collisions—when two different keys hash to the same index.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            A classic computer science problem that integrates data structures and algorithmic logic is the evaluation of mathematical expressions from a string. This task requires careful handling of operator precedence and nested structures like parentheses.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3.1 Basic Calculator Expression Evaluation</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The problem is to evaluate a string representing a mathematical expression, such as "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)", respecting the standard order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS), without using built-in functions like `eval()`.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            A robust approach for this is to use an adaptation of Dijkstra's Shunting-yard algorithm, which uses two stacks: one for numeric values and one for operators. This method correctly handles operator precedence and parentheses by converting the standard infix notation to a postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) representation, which is then trivial to evaluate.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            A simplified version of this problem, common in technical interviews, involves expressions with `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` but no parentheses. This can be solved efficiently in a single pass using one stack. The key is to process higher-precedence operators (`*`, `/`) immediately, while deferring lower-precedence ones (`+`, `-`).

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This report has traversed a curated selection of fundamental algorithms, from number theory and searching to complex graph traversals and dynamic programming solutions. The analysis consistently reveals that the design and selection of an algorithm is a process of navigating critical trade-offs. There is no universally "best" algorithm; the optimal choice is always contingent upon the specific constraints of the problem at hand, including the nature of the input data, memory limitations, and the need for predictable performance.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Three major algorithmic paradigms have been explored:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer</strong>, exemplified by Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search, demonstrates the power of recursively breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Its efficiency is often logarithmic in nature, a direct result of this recursive partitioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms</strong>, showcased by Dijkstra's algorithm, build a solution step-by-step by making the locally optimal choice at each stage. While often simpler and faster, their correctness depends on the problem possessing the greedy choice property, a condition that does not always hold.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>, illustrated by the Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, and LCS, provides a systematic method for solving complex problems with overlapping subproblems. By storing the results of subproblems, it transforms otherwise intractable exponential-time problems into solvable polynomial-time ones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
            A recurring theme is the profound and inseparable relationship between algorithms and data structures. The choice between a queue and a stack entirely dictates the traversal pattern of BFS versus DFS. The use of a priority queue is what makes Dijkstra's algorithm efficient. The 2D table is the very foundation of the DP solutions for Knapsack and LCS. This underscores that data structures are not mere implementation details but are core components that enable and shape an algorithm's logic and behavior. A deep, functional understanding of these foundational algorithms and their underlying principles is, therefore, indispensable for the engineering of efficient, scalable, and robust computational solutions.
